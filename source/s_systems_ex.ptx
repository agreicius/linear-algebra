    <title>Geometry of linear systems</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        In this exercise we will use the geometry of lines in <m>\R^2</m> and planes in <m>\R^3</m> to help analyze solutions to systems of equations in two and three unknowns, respectively. See <xref ref="eg_lines_planes_review"/> for a refresher on these concepts. 
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Fix <m>m\gt 1</m> and consider a system of <m>m</m> linear equations in the two unknowns <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.
            What does a solution <m>(x,y)</m> to this <em>system</em>
            of linear equations correspond to geometrically?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use your interpretation in (a) to give a <em>geometric</em>
            argument that a system of <m>m</m> equations in two unknowns will have either (i) zero solutions, (ii) exactly one solution,
            or (iii) infinitely many solutions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use your geometric interpretation to help produce explicit examples of systems in two variables satisfying these three different cases (i)-(iii).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now repeat (a)-(b) for a system of linear equations in three variables <m>x,y, z</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        (a) Geometrically,
        each equation in the system represents a line <m>\ell_i\colon a_ix+b_iy=c_i</m>.
        A solution <m>(x,y)</m> to the <m>i</m>-th equation corresponds to a point on <m>\ell_i</m>.
        Thus a solution <m>(x,y)</m> to the system corresponds to a point lying on
        <em>all</em> of the lines:
        i.e., a point of intersection of the lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) First of all to prove the desired
        <q>or</q>
        statement it suffices to prove that if the number of solutions is greater than 1, then there are infinitely many solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now suppose there is more than one solution.
        Then there are at least two different solutions:
        <m>P_1=(x_1,y_1)</m> and <m>P_2=(x_2,y_2)</m>.
        Take any of the two lines <m>\ell_i, \ell_j</m>.
        By above the intersection of <m>\ell_i</m> and <m>\ell_j</m> contains <m>P_1</m> and <m>P_2</m>.
        But two <em>distinct</em> lines intersect in at most one point.
        It follows that <m>\ell_i</m> and <m>\ell_j</m> must be equal.
        Since <m>\ell_i</m> and <m>\ell_j</m> were arbitrary,
        it follows <em>all</em> of the lines <m>\ell_i</m> are in fact the same line <m>\ell</m>.
        But this means the common intersection of the lines is <m>\ell</m>,
        which has infinitely many points.
        It follows that the system has infinitely many solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) We will get 0 solutions if the system includes two different parallel lines:
        e.g., <m>\ell_1\colon x+y=5</m> and <m>\ell_2\colon x+y=1</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will get exactly one solution when the slopes of each line in the system are distinct.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will get infinitely many solutions when <em>all</em>
        equations in the system represent the <em>same line</em>.
        This happens when all equations are multiples of one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        (d) Now each equation in our system defines a plane <m>\mathcal{P}_i\colon a_ix+b_iy+c_iz=d_i</m>.
        A solution <m>(x,y,z)</m> to the system corresponds to a point
        <m>P=(x,y,z)</m> of intersection of the planes.
        We recall two facts from Euclidean geometry:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <title>Fact 1</title>
            <p>
              Given two distinct points, there is a unique line containing both of them.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Fact 2</title>
            <p>
              Given any number of distinct planes,
              they either do not intersect, or intersect in a line.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        We proceed as in part (b) above:
        that is show that if there are two distinct solutions to the system,
        then there are infinitely many solutions.
        First, for simplicity,
        we may assume that the equations <m>\mathcal{P}_i\colon a_ix+b_iy+c_iz=d_i</m> define
        <em>distinct</em> planes;
        if we have two equations defining the same plane,
        we can delete one of them and not change the set of solutions to the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now suppose <m>P=(x_1,y_1,z_1)</m> and
        <m>Q=(x_2,y_2,z_2)</m> are two distinct solutions to the system.
        Let <m>\ell</m> be the unique line containing <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> (Fact 1).
        I claim that <m>\ell</m> is precisely the set of solutions to the system.
        To see this, take any two equations in the system
        <m>\mathcal{P}_i\colon a_ix+b_iy+c_iz=d_i</m> and <m>\mathcal{P}_j\colon a_jx+b_jy+c_iz=d_j</m>.
        Since the two corresponding planes are distinct,
        and intersect in at least the points <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>,
        they must intersect in a line (Fact 2);
        since this line contains <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>,
        it must be the line <m>\ell</m> (Fact 1).
        Thus any two planes in the system intersect in the line <m>\ell</m>.
        From this it follows that: (a) a point satisfying the system must lie in <m>\ell</m>;
        and (b) all points on <m>\ell</m> satisfy the system
        (since we have shown that <m>\ell</m> lies in all the planes).
        It follows that <m>\ell</m> is precisely the set of solutions,
        and hence that there are infinitely many solutions.

  <exercise xml:id="ex_row_ops_preserve">
    <title>Row operations preserve solutions</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        We made the claim that each of our three row operations
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              scalar multiplication (<m>e_i\mapsto c\cdot e_i</m> for <m>c\ne 0</m>),
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              swap (<m>e_i\leftrightarrow e_j</m>),
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              addition (<m>e_i\mapsto e_i+c\cdot e_j</m> for some <m>c</m>)
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      do not change the set of solutions of a linear system.
      To prove this claim, let <m>L</m> be a general linear system
      <me>
        \numeqsys
      </me>.
      Now consider each type of row operation separately,
      write down the new system <m>L'</m> you get by applying this row operation,
      and prove that an <m>n</m>-tuple
      <m>s=(s_1,s_2,\dots ,s_n)</m> is a solution to the original system <m>L</m> if and only if it is a solution to the new system <m>L'</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
        <p>
          Let <m>L</m> be the original system with equations <m>e_1,e_2,\dots ,e_m</m>.
          For each specified row operation,
          we will call the resulting new system <m>L'</m> and its equations <m>e'_1,e'_2,\dots , e'_m</m>.
        </p>
        <case>
        <title>Row swap</title>
              <p>
                In this case systems <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m> have exactly the same equations,
                just written in a different order.
                Thus the <m>n</m>-tuple <m>s</m> satisfies <m>L</m> if and only if it satisfies each of the equations <m>e_i</m>,
                if and only if it satisfies each of the equations <m>e'_i</m>,
                since these are the same equations!
                It follows that <m>s</m> is a solution of <m>L</m> if and only if it is a solution to <m>L'</m>.
              </p>
        </case>
        <case>
              <title>Scalar multiplication</title>
              <p>
                In this case <m>e_j=e'_j</m> for all <m>j\ne i</m>,
                and <m>e'_i=c\cdot e_i</m> for some <m>c\ne 0</m>.
                Since only the <m>i</m>-th equation has changed,
                it suffices to show that <m>s</m> is a solution to <m>e_i</m> if and only if <m>s</m> is a solution to <m>c\cdot e_i</m>.
                Let's prove each direction of this if and only if separately.
              </p>
                <p>
                  If <m>s</m> satisfies <m>e_1</m>, then <m>a_{i1}s_1+a_{i2}s_2+\cdots +a_{in}s_n=b_i</m>. Multiplying both sides by <m>c</m> we see that
                  <me>
                    ca_{i1}s_1+ca_{i2}s_2+\cdots +ca_{in}s_n=cb_i,
                  </me>
                  and hence that <m>s</m> is also a solution of <m>c\,e_i=e_i'</m>.

                </p>
                <p>
                  For the other direction, if <m>s</m> satisfies <m>c e_i=e_i'</m>, then
                  <me>
                    ca_{ii}s_1+ca_{i2}s_2+\cdots ca_{in}s_n=cb_i.
                  </me>
                  Now, since <m>c\ne 0</m>, we can multiply both sides of this equation by <m>1/c</m> to see that
                  <me>
                    a_{i1}s_1+a_{i2}s_2+\cdots +a_{in}s_n=b_i
                  </me>
                  and hence that <m>s</m> is a solution to <m>e_i</m>.

                </p>

            </case>
            <case>
              <title>Row addition</title>
              <p>
                The only equation of <m>L'</m> that differs from <m>L</m> is
                <me>
                  e_i'=e_i+ce_j
                </me>.
                Writing this equation out in terms of coefficients gives us
                <me>
                  e_i': a_{i1}x_1+a_{i2}x_2+\cdots +a_{in}x_n+c(a_{j1}x_1+a_{j2}x_2+\cdots +a_{jn}x_n)=b_i+cb_j
                </me>.
                Now if <m>s</m> satisfies <m>L</m>,
                then it satisfies <m>e_i</m> and <m>e_j</m>,
                in which case evaluating the RHS of the <m>e_i'</m> above at <m>s</m> yields

                  <mrow>a_{i1}s_1+a_{i2}s_2+\cdots +a_{in}s_n+c(a_{j1}s_1+a_{j2}s_2+\cdots +a_{jn}s_n)\amp =b_i+cb_j</mrow>
                </md>
                showing that <m>s</m> satisfies <m>e_i'</m>.
                Now suppose <m>s=(s_1,s_2,\dots,
                s_n)</m> satisfies <m>L'</m>.
                Since <m>s</m> satisfies <m>e_j'=e_j</m>, we have
                <men xml:id="solveeqn" tag="star">
                  a_{j1}s_1+a_{j2}s_2+\cdots +a_{jn}s_n =b_j
                </men>
                Since <m>s</m> satisfies <m>e_i'</m>, we have
                <me>
                  a_{i1}s_1+a_{i2}s_2+\cdots +a_{in}s_n+c(a_{j1}s_1+a_{j2}s_2+\cdots +a_{jn}s_n)=b_i+cb_j
                </me>
                Substituting <xref ref="solveeqn"/> into the equation above we get
                <me>
                  a_{i1}s_1+a_{i2}s_2+\cdots +a_{in}s_n+c(b_j)=b_i+cb_j
                </me>,
                and hence

                This shows that <m>s</m> satisfies <m>e_i</m>.
                It follows that <m>s</m> satisfies <m>L</m>.
