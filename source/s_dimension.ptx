  <title>Dimension</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    Intuitively, we think of <m>\R^2</m> as a two-dimensional space, and <m>\R^3</m> as three-dimensional one. Why? Loosely speaking this notion of dimension has something to do with the number of degrees of freedom involved in specifying a particular element of the given space: to specify an element of <m>\boldv\in \R^2</m> we need to give its two coordinates; to specify an element of <m>\R^3</m> we need to give its three coordinates. Clearly, this conception is too imprecise to serve as a mathematical definition. What exactly does <q>degrees of freedom</q> mean? And how do you quantify the number of <q>degrees of freedom</q> needed for a given space? For example, we also think of a plane <m>W\subseteq \R^3</m> passing through the origin as a two-dimensional object; it is not immediately clear how to square this intuition with our vague <q>degrees of freedom</q> formulation. In this section we introduce the definition of the <em>dimension</em> of a vector space, which will be a rigorous articulation of these notions. Our definition, which relies on the concept of bases, seems simple enough: the dimension of a vector space <m>V</m> is defined as the number of elements contained in any basis <m>B</m> of <m>V</m>. However, as we will see there is  considerable work involved (a) in proving that this definition is well-defined, and (b) in showing that it captures the intuition of dimension described above.

  The following theorem is the crucial result needed to show that any two finite bases of a vector space have the same cardinality.
  <theorem xml:id="th_basis_span_bounds">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>S</m> is a finite spanning set for the vector space <m>V</m> and let <m>\val{S}=n</m>. If <m>S'</m> is a finite set with <m>\val{S'}=r>n</m>, then <m>S'</m> is linearly dependent.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>S=\{\boldv_1, \boldv_2, \dots, \boldv_n\}</m>, and let <m>S'=\{\boldw_1, \boldw_2, \dots, \boldw_r\}</m>. Since <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>, each element of <m>S'</m> is a linear combination of elements of <m>S</m>: <ie />, we have
        <men xml:id="eq_basis_bound">
          \boldw_j=a_{1j}\boldv_1+a_{2j}\boldv_2+\cdots a_{nj}\boldv_n=\sum_{i=1}^n\boldv_{ij}
        </men>
        for all <m>1\leq j\leq r</m>. Now consider the following chain of equivalences:
        <md>
          <mrow>c_1\boldw_1+c_2\boldw_2+\cdots c_r\boldw_r=\boldzero \amp \iff c_1(\sum_{i=1}^n\boldv_{i1})+c_2(\sum_{i=1}^n\boldv_{i2})+\cdots +c_r\sum_{i=1}^n\boldv_{in}=\boldzero\amp (<xref ref="eq_basis_bound"/>) </mrow>
          <mrow>  \amp \iff \sum_{j=1}^rc_j\sum_{i=1}^na_{ij}\boldv_i=\boldzero</mrow>
          <mrow> \amp\iff \sum_{i=1}^n(\sum_{j=1}^ra_{ij}c_j)\boldv_i=\boldzero  </mrow>
          <mrow>  \amp \iff (\sum_{j=1}^ra_{1j}c_j)\boldv_1+(\sum_{j=1}^ra_{2j}c_j)\boldv_2+\cdots (\sum_{j=1}^ra_{nj}c_j)\boldv_n=\boldzero </mrow>
        </md>.
        From the last vector equation, we see that if we can find a nonzero sequence <m>(c_1,c_2,\dots, c_r)</m> satisfying
        <me>
          \sum_{j=1}^ra_{ij}c_j=0
        </me>
        for all <m>1\leq i\leq n</m>, then there is a nontrivial combination of the <m>\boldw_i</m> equal to the zero vector, and hence that <m>S'</m> is linearly dependent. Such a sequence <m>(c_1,c_2,\dots, c_n)</m> corresponds to a solution to the homogeneous linear with augmented matrix
        <me>
          \begin{amatrix}[r|r]
          A\amp \boldzero
          \end{amatrix}
        </me>,
        where <m>A=[a_{ij}]_{n\times r}</m>. Since this is a homogeneous system of <m>n</m> equations in <m>r</m> unknowns, and since <m>r>n</m>, there are in fact infinitely many solutions. (The system has at most <m>n</m> leading ones, and so there must be a free variable since one of the <m>r</m> columns in the equivalent row echelon matrix must fail to contain a leading one.) In particular there is a nonzero solution <m>(c_1,c_2,\dots, c_n)\ne \boldzero</m>, and we conclude that <m>S'</m> is linearly dependent.
      </p>
    </proof>
  </theorem>
  The next theorem not only ensures that our definition of dimension (<xref text="global" ref="d_dimension"/>) is well-defined, it also characterizes dimension as the minimal cardinality of a spanning set, and the maximal cardinality of a linearly independent set.

    <statement>
      <p>
      Wouldn't it have been more natural to simply say <m>V</m> is infinite dimensional if it has an infinite basis? As it turns out this is indeed equivalent to not having a finite basis, but to prove this we need to establish the general fact that we can always find a basis for a given vector space <m>V</m>. As intuitive as that claim may sound (<ie />, that bases always exist), its proof requires some set theory methods that are not covered in this text. As such we will not include it in our treatment of dimension, and so will have to make do with our slightly awkward definition of infinite-dimensional vector spaces.

The <q>contracting and expanding</q> theorem below is very useful theoretical consequence of <xref ref="th_basis_dimension"/>. It allows us to construct a customized basis from a given set <m>S</m>. This method is used prominently in the proof of the <xref ref="th_rank-nullity" text="custom">rank-nullity theorem </xref>.

          If <m>S</m> spans <m>V</m>, then there is a subset of <m>S</m> that is a basis of <m>V</m>: <ie />, we can <em>contract</em> a spanning set to a basis.

  <proof>
    <p> Let <m>S=\{\boldv_1, \boldv_2, \dots , \boldv_r\}</m>.

          Assume <m>\Span S=V</m>. Let <m>S'</m> be a subset of <m>S</m> of <em>minimal cardinality</em> such that <m>\Span S'</m> is still equal to <m>V</m>. Such a set is guaranteed to exist: since <m>S</m> is finite, it has a finite number of subsets; of these subsets some will span, others will not; of the subsets that do span, there will be one (or more) that has the least number of elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            We claim that such a spanning subset <m>S'</m> of minimal cardinality is linearly independent, and hence is a basis for <m>V</m>, as desired. We give a proof by contradiction. Suppose <m>S'</m> is linearly dependent. Then some element of <m>S'</m>, call it <m>\boldv_0</m>, can be expressed as a linear combination of the other elements (<xref ref="rm_linear_independence"/>). Then in terms of span, the element <m>\boldv_0</m> is <q>redundant</q>. In other words, if we let <m>S''=S'-\{\boldv_0\}</m>, the set obtained by <q>throwing out</q> <m>\boldv_0</m>, then we have <m>\Span S''=\Span S'=V</m>. Since <m>\val{S''} &lt; \val{S}</m>, this contradicts our choice of <m>S'</m> as a spanning set of minimal cardinality. We conclude that <m>S'</m> is linearly independent, completing the proof.

                Each <m>S_i</m> is linearly independent. This can be shown by induction, the crucial point being that if <m>S_i</m> is linearly independent, and if <m>\boldv\notin \Span S_i</m>, then <m>S_{i+1}=S_i\cup \{\boldv_0\}</m> is linearly independent. The proof is left as an exercise.

                  The procedure must halt. Why? Since <m>\dim V=n</m>, and since each <m>S_i</m> is linearly independent, we must have <m>\val{S_i}\leq n</m> for all <m>i</m> by <xref ref="th_basis_dimension"/>. Since <m>\val{S_i}&lt; \val{S_{i+1}}</m> and <m>\val{S_{i}}\leq n</m>, the procedure must halt in at most <m>n</m> steps.

            From (ii) we may assume the procedure halts at <m>S_k</m> for some <m>k\geq 0</m>. From (i) we know that <m>S_k</m> is linearly independent. Furthermore, since the procedure halts at <m>S_k</m>, we know that <m>\Span S_k=V</m>. It follows that <m>B=S_k</m> is a basis containing <m>S</m>, as desired.

The following corollary follows from <xref ref="th_basis_dimension"/> and <xref ref="th_basis_contract_expand"/>. We call it a <q>street smarts</q> result as the first two statements give us a quick and dirty way of dashing a set's hopes of being a basis. The third statement asserts that when a finite set's cardinality matches the dimension of a space, then to prove it is a basis it suffices to prove either one of the two defining properties of <xref ref="d_basis"/>.

  We are often in a situation where we wish to show a given subspace of a vector space is in fact the entire space. For example, when deciding whether a set <m>S</m> spans a vector space <m>V</m>, we are asking whether <m>W=\Span S</m> is all of <m>V</m>. As another example, given a linear transformation <m>T\colon V\rightarrow W</m>, one of the first things we wish to determine is whether the subspace <m>\im T</m> is in fact all of <m>W</m>. As the next result illustrates, dimension is a very useful tool in this regard.

          If <m>W\subseteq V</m> is a subspace, then <m>\dim W=\dim V</m> if and only if <m>W=V</m>.

  <proof>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Firstly, if <m>\dim V=\infty</m>, then clearly <m>\dim W\leq \dim V</m> for any subspace <m>W\subseteq V</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now assume <m>\dim V=n</m>. Apply the <q>extending to a basis</q> procedure described in the proof of <xref ref="th_basis_contract_expand"/> to the emptyset <m>S=\{\}</m>, which is lienarly independent, considered as a subset of <m>W</m>: <ie />, at each stage, if the current set <m>S_i</m> is not a basis of <m>W</m>, add any element <m>\boldb\notin \Span S_i</m>. Since <m>W\subseteq V</m>, and since <m>\dim V\leq n</m>, the linearly independent sets <m>S_i</m> cannot have more than <m>n</m> elements; thus the procedure must halt with a basis <m>B</m> of <m>W</m> satisfying <m>\val{B}\leq n</m>. We conclude that <m>\dim W\leq \dim V</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Clearly, if <m>W=V</m>, then <m>\dim W=\dim V</m>. For the other direction, assume <m>\dim W=\dim V=n</m>. Let <m>B</m> be a basis for <m>W</m>. Since <m>B</m> is lienarly independent, it can be extended to a basis <m>B'</m> of <m>V</m> (<xref ref="th_basis_contract_expand" text="global"/>). Since <m>\val{B}=\dim W=\dim V</m>, and since all bases of <m>V</m> have cardinality <m>n</m>, we must have <m>B=B'</m>. It follows that <m>B</m> is also a basis of <m>V</m>, and hence that
            <me>
              V=\Span B=W
            </me>.
