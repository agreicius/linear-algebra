  <title>Polynomials</title>
<introduction>
  Polynomials will play an important role in our treatment of linear algebra both in terms of building examples of vector spaces (<xref ref="d_subspace_functions" text="global"/>) and as tools for studying linear operators (<xref ref="d_char_poly_transform" text="global"/>). We gather here some basic definitions and properties of polynomials. Although we will primarily be concerned with polynomials with real coefficients in this course, it is convenient to develop the theory over the complex numbers. As with <xref ref="s_complex_numbers"/>, all theorems will be stated without proof.

  <title>Degree of a polynomial</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    Once we know that the expression <m>f(x)=\anpoly</m> is unique, the various attributes of the polynomial expression (<eg />, leading term, leading coefficient, <etc />) can now be understood as properties of the function <m>f</m> itself. The following definition introduces once more such property, the <em>degree</em> of a polynomial. Note that the definition assumes we are in the setting stipulated in <xref ref="cor_poly_equality"/> to ensure uniqueness of the polynomial expression.

    <description>degree of polynomial <m>f</m></description>
  </notation>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Assume <m>X</m> is an infinite subset of <m>\C</m> and that <m>Y=\R</m> or <m>Y=\C</m>. Let <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> be a nonzero polynomial function, and let <m>f(x)=\anpoly</m> be its unique polynomial expression with <m>a_n\ne 0</m>. The <term>degree</term> of <m>f</m>, denoted <m>\deg f</m>, is defined as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            if <m>f</m> is the zero function, then we define <m>\deg f=-\infty</m>;
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            otherwise, we can write <m>f(x)=\anpoly</m> where <m>a_n\ne 0</m>, and we define <m>\deg f=n</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      We call the polynomial <m>f</m> <term>linear</term> if <m>\deg f=1</m>, <term>quadratic</term> if <m>\deg f=2</m>, and <term>cubic</term> if <m>\deg f=3</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
</definition>
<p>
  Defining the degree of the zero function to be <m>-\infty</m> may seem a little peculiar. Do not be disturbed! You can think of this as a convention that allows for clean statements of theorems like the following.

<subsection xml:id="ss_poly_factoring">
  <title>Factoring polynomials</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Statement (2) of <xref ref="th_poly_basic"/> makes a connection between roots of a polynomial and factorization; and the expression <xref ref="eq_poly_factor"/> can be thought of as a first step in writing the polynomial <m>f</m> as a product of linear polynomials. The existence of roots depends on the given domain of the function. Indeed,  there are plenty of polynomials <m>f\colon \R\rightarrow \R</m> that have no roots whatsoever: for example, from the quadratic formula we know that any quadratic polynomial <m>f(x)=ax^2+bx+c</m> satisfying <m>b^2-4ac\lt 0</m> has no real roots. According to the <xref ref="th_fund_alg" text="custom">fundamental theorem of algebra</xref>, the situation over <m>\C</m> is vastly different: not only does every polymonial have a root in <m>\C</m>, we can factor it completely as a product of linear polynomials. This is one of the main incentives for introducing the complex numbers as a number system.
    </p>
  </introduction>
  <theorem xml:id="th_fund_alg">
    <title>Fundamental theorem of algebra</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Any polynomial <m>f(x)=\anpoly</m>, thought of as a function from <m>\C</m> to itself, can be factored into linear terms as
        <me>
          f(x)=(x-z_1)(x-z_2)\cdots (x-z_n)
        </me>,
        where the <m>z_i</m> are (not necessarily distinct) complex numbers.
