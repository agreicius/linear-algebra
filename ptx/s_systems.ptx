    We begin in a deceptively simple manner with the study of systems of linear equations and their solutions.

    <title>Linear equations</title>
    <idx><h>linear equation</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>linear equation</term> in the <m>n</m> <term>unknowns</term>
        (or <term>variables</term>)
        <m>x_1,x_2,\dots x_n</m> is an equation of the form
        <me>
          c_1x_1+c_2x_2+\cdots +c_nx_n+d=e_1x_1+e_2x_2+\cdots +e_nx_n+f,
        </me>
        where <m>d, f, c_1,\dots, c_n, d_1,\dots, d_n</m> are real numbers. An equation not of this form is called <term>nonlinear</term>.
      </p>
      <p>Any linear equation in the unknowns <m>x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n</m> can be simplified, using only addition and subtraction, to an equation of the form
        <men xml:id="eq_std_form">
          a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots a_nx_n=b,
        </men>
        which we call its <term>standard form </term>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given a linear equation with standard form as in <xref ref="eq_std_form"/>, the equation is called <term>homogeneous</term> if <m>b=0</m>, and <term>nonhomogeneous</term> if <m>b\ne 0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>

    <statement>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Consider <m>\sqrt{3}x+\sin(5)=2z-e^4y</m>.
            This is a linear equation in the unknowns <m>x,y,z</m>. Its standard form is <m>\sqrt{3}x+e^4y-2z=-\sin(5)</m>.
            Since the right-hand side is nonzero, we see that the equation is nonhomogenous.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The equation <m>x^2+y^2=1</m> is a <em> nonlinear</em>

        A <term>system of linear equations</term>
        (or <term>linear system</term>)
        is a set of linear equations.

  When displaying a system of <m>m</m> equations in the <m>n</m> unknowns <m>x_1,x_2,\dots x_n</m>, we typically write each equation in standard form and align the corresponding terms of each equation into columns:
    <me>
      \eqsys
    </me>
A homogeneous system is thus typically written as:
<me>
  \homsys.
</me>

      You will want to get comfortable with the double-indexing used to display linear systems as quickly as possible. Here is a good way to orient yourself:

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The <m>i</m> appearing in <m>a_{ij}</m> and <m>b_i</m> indicates the <m>i</m>-th row in our displayed system, or equivalently, the <m>i</m>-th equation.

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The <m>j</m> appearing in <m>a_{ij}</m>
        indicates the <m>j</m>-th column in our displayed system, which is associated to the <m>j</m>-th variable, for <m>1\leq j\leq n</m>.

    Given a linear system we will seek to find the set of
    <em>all</em> solutions to the system.
    As we will soon see, this set of solutions will take one of three qualitative forms:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The solution set is empty; i.e., there are no solutions.
          We say the system is <term>inconsistent</term> in this case.
          Otherwise a system is called <term>consistent</term>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The solution set contains a single element;
          i.e., there is exactly one solution.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The solution set contains infinitely many elements;
          i.e., there are infinitely solutions.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <example xml:id="s_systems_eg_2eqns2varss">
    <statement>
    <p>
    For each system, compute the set of solutions.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <me>\begin{linsys}{2} x\amp -\amp y\amp =\amp 0\\ x\amp -\amp y\amp =\amp 1\end{linsys}</me>

    </ol>
    </statement>
   <solution>
    <ol>
      <li><p>The first equation implies <m>x=y</m>.
    Substituting <m>y</m> for <m>x</m> in the second equation, we would then have <m>0=1</m>, a contradiction.
    Thus there are no solutions: i.e., <m>S</m> is the empty set, denoted <m>S=\{ \ \}</m> or <m>S=\emptyset</m>.
    </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The first equation implies <m>x=y</m>.
          Making this substitution in the second equation yields <m>2x=1</m>, or <m>x=1/2</m>.
          Thus <m>(x,y)=(1/2,1/2)</m> is the unique solution,
          and <m>S=\{ (1/2,1/2)\}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The second equation is just twice the first. It follows that both equations have the exact same set of solutions, and
          so we need only find all solutions to <m>x-y=1</m>.
          Note that we can set <m>x=t</m> for <em>any</em>
          real number <m>t \in\R</m>.
          Solving for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>t</m> we get
          <m>(x,y)=(t,t-1)</m> for any <m>t\in\R</m>,
          and thus <m>S=\{(t,t-1)\colon t\in\R\}</m>, an infinite set!

      </li>
  </ol>
  </solution>

</example>
<p>
  In <xref ref="s_systems_eg_2eqns2varss"/> we were able to combine some simple logic and arithmetic to solve each system completely. (A more geometric approach is discussed in <xref ref="ex_solving_sys_geom"/>.) Of course, things get more complicated as the number of equations and/or unknowns in the system increases.
</p>
<p>
  For example, consider the system
    <men xml:id="s_systems_eq_runningexample">
      \begin{linsys}{3} 2x\amp -\amp y\amp -\amp z\amp =\amp 3\\ x\amp \amp \amp -\amp z\amp =\amp 2 \\ x\amp -\amp y\amp \amp \amp =\amp 1 \end{linsys}
    </men>
  Observe first that the sequence <m>(5,2,5)</m> is not a solution to the system; one easily checks that is satisfies the first and second equations, but not the third. Similarly, it is easy to verify that <m>(4,2,3)</m> and <m>(0,-1,2)</m> are both solutions to the system. The question remains: How do we find <em>all</em> solutions to the linear system in a systematic way?
</p>
<remark>
  <p>Observe the somewhat funny spacing in <xref ref="s_systems_eq_runningexample"/>. This is in force in order to align the unknowns in separate columns. In general, when handed a linear system in the wild, your first step should be to write each equation in standard form, and make sure the unknowns are aligned vertically in this manner.

  The staircase pattern of <m>L'</m> allows us to solve easily by
    <em>backwards substitution</em>. In more detail:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Equation 3 in <m>L'</m> tells us that <m>z=2</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
      Now substitute <m>z=2</m> into Equation 2 of <m>L'</m> and solve for <m>y</m> to get <m>y=4</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
      Finally, substitute <m>y=4</m> and <m>z=2</m> into Equation 1 of <m>L'</m>and solve for <m>x</m> to get <m>x=4</m>.
      We conclude that <m>(x,y,z)=(4,4,2)</m> is a solution to <m>L'</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Furthermore, since at each step we had no choice in the matter (<m>z</m> must be equal to 2, <m>y</m> then must be equal to 4, etc.), we see that in fact <m>(4,4,2)</m> is the <em>only</em> solution to <m>L'</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
    Our method for solving a more complicated system,
    like <m>L</m> above, will be to <em>transform</em>
    it to a simpler system like <m>L'</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Key point</em>. In order for this method to work,
    we need to make sure that the transformed system has <em>exactly</em>
    the same solutions as the original system!
    To this end we will restrict ou permissible transformations to the <em>elementary  operations</em> define below.

    <p>
      After reducing a linear system <m>L</m> using elementary operations, we are left with a new system <m>L'</m>. The systems <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m> will generally look very different from one another. Note, however, that the two systems will have the same <em>number</em> of equations, and the same <em>number</em> of variables. More importantly, the two systems will have identical sets of solutions; that is, the set of solutions of the new system <m>L'</m> is identical to the set of solutions to <m>L</m>!
    </p>
    <p> To convince ourselves of this last assertion, it suffices to show that the application of any one of these elementary row operations produces a new system <m>L'</m> with exactly the same set of solutions as <m>L</m>; if this is so, then performing any finite sequence of elementary row operations must also preserve the set of solutions in this sense. <xref ref="s_systems_th_rowops"/> will make these claims official. For now let's look at an example.

<p>
  You may be tempted to do multiple operations in a single step during this procedure. Resist this temptation for now until we have a better understanding of things.
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, if later on you do give in to this temptation, make sure that the two (or more row operations) you perform are independent of one another. For example, do not swap <m>e_2</m> with <m>e_1</m> and replace <m>e_3</m> with <m>e_3-5e_2</m> in the same step.

        We say two systems of linear equations are
        <term>equivalent</term>
        if the one can be obtained from the other by a finite sequence of row operations.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Equivalent systems of linear equations have identical sets of solutions.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <proof>
      We prove by induction that if system <m>L'</m> is the result of applying <m>n</m> elementary operations to system <m>L</m>, <m>n\geq 0</m> then <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m> have the same set of solutions.
      <case>
        <title> Base case: <m>n=0</m></title>
        <p>
          In this case <m>L=L'</m> (we have applied no operations) and the statement is obvious.
        </p>
      </case>
      <case>
        <title>Induction step</title>
        <p>Assume that applying a sequence of <m>n</m> elementary operations to a linear system preserves the set of solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose <m>L'</m> is the result of applying <m>n+1</m> elementary operations to the system <m>L</m>. Let <m>L''</m> be the result of applying the first <m>n</m> of these operations. By the induction hypothesis, systems <m>L</m> and <m>L''</m> have the same set of solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the system <m>L'</m> is obtained from <m>L''</m> by applying exactly one elementary operation, <xref ref="solving_ex_row_ops"/> implies <m>L'</m> and <m>L''</m> have the same set of solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        We conclude that <m>L</m> and <m>L'</m> have the same set of solutions, as desired.
